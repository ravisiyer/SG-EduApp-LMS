# Slightly Modified Version of Simon Grimm's Tutorial: React Native LMS with Strapi, Clerk & RevenueCat

This is a slightly modified version of the frontend repository of Simon Grimm's tutorial project on React Native LMS with Strapi, Clerk & RevenueCat.  

Here is [the original app frontend code published by Simon Grimm](https://github.com/Galaxies-dev/lms-react-native).  

The tutorial video: [Simon Grimm: Build Your Own MASTERCLASS clone in React Native](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fO3D8lNs10c), 4 hrs. 42 mins, Mar. 2025.  

 I found the tutorial very helpful to learn the topics covered in it. Many thanks to Simon Grimm for creating such a detailed learning resource.  

The Readme of the above repo has a [Demo section](https://github.com/Galaxies-dev/lms-react-native?tab=readme-ov-file#demo) with animated demos of the mobile app, followed by mobile app screenshots and web app screenshots. That's followed by Strapi screenshots showing how the course content is organized and specified at the Strapi backend using Strapi admin panel. 

Simon Grimm kindly permitted me (over email on 13 Nov. 2025) to publish this slightly modified version of his app frontend code. 

I think this modified repository's code should work with the same Strapi backend used by Simon Grimm's original repo. I made some minor superficial changes to the original backend project but I think those changes do not affect functionality of the backend.
