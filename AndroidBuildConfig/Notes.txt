Gradle and some other build tool versions that are relevant to AGP (Android Gradle Plugin) version, used in successful build on 13 Aug. 2025

From android/gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties:
distributionUrl=https\://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-8.10.2-all.zip
----

android/build.gradle does NOT have a plugin section that explicitly defines the AGP version. But, as per Gemini, the lines that are most relevant to determining the AGP version implicitly are:
[In buildscript.dependencies block, AGP classpath] 
	classpath('com.android.tools.build:gradle')
	classpath('com.facebook.react:react-native-gradle-plugin')

[In buildscript.ext block] 
        compileSdkVersion = Integer.parseInt(findProperty('android.compileSdkVersion') ?: '35')
        kotlinVersion = findProperty('android.kotlinVersion') ?: '1.9.25'

        ndkVersion = "26.1.10909125"
----
============================

As per Gem, "the AGP version is almost certainly 8.6.0, as this is the version that aligns with Gradle 8.10.2 and a compileSdkVersion of 35".

On command for showing build output on console as well as saving it in a log file, Gem said:
